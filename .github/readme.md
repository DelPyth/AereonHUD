# AereonHUD
A HUD using Arekk's HUD as a base.

The original idea was to copy a different HUD's fonts and a few styles over but I got carried away and now here I am with this fun little thing.

## Something doesn't look right.
Tell me. I'll get to it eventually.

## Can you add X customization?
Maybe...? I don't have plans for *every* tiny thing, but I can try.

## Any chance you'll add minmode?
I have an idea of what I want to do, but it's not going to happen overnight.
My idea is to have minmode be similar in style to KBN hud with the ammo and health being squished down and close together.
The reasoning for this is to create a smaller, more streamlined style where all of the information you *need* is readily available whereas lesser important stuff like the cart placement and killfeed are smaller and out of the way. I have no intention of it working or looking good as I'm already quite comfortable with the current hud anyway.
