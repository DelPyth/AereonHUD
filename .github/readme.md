# AereonHUD
A HUD using Arekk's HUD as a base.

The original idea was to copy a different HUD's fonts and a few styles over but I got carried away and now here I am with this fun little thing.

## Something doesn't look right.
Tell me. I'll get to it eventually.

## Can you add X customization?
Maybe...? I don't have plans for *every* tiny thing, but I can try.

## Minmode!
I have finally added a minmode to the HUD. Keep in mind it is different to what I originally planned, I find this version much cleaner.
